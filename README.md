# SURVEY OF BUTTERFLIES IN MELBOURNE 2017

The data for this report comes from an Our City's Little Gems study that was carried out in Melbourne between January and March 2017 and looked at butterfly biodiversity and flower-butterfly interactions. The researchers in the original study noted what butterflies they saw in different parts of Melbourne. A single study site had several plants and locations, and the researchers visited these sites multiple times during the study. This helped them to investigate which varieties of butterflies they could find, during what time of the day, and under what meteorological circumstances. An altered portion of the original data is used for the study.
